# Business Analysis to Improve Usability of WSDOT&#39;s DOTS Tool

## Description

In collaboration with business, library, and technical stakeholders at the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), University of Washington Open Data Literacy (ODL) intern Tim Blankemeyer will assist with a business analysis of the department&#39;s data catalog—Data or Term Search (DOTS)—to improve usability.

DOTS features a web interface for staff to query WSDOT&#39;s inventory of databases for existing data and associated metadata; the inventory is populated by automated software processes and augmented by DOTS administrators and business data stewards.

DOTS provides thorough, connected, and integrated information about business metadata and the physical descriptions of data, but it does not provide clear business context of the content represented by that physical data. Thus, it inadequately serves:

- **Business stakeholders** seeking knowledge about
  - what content exists,
  - who are the knowledge authorities for a particular domain of content, and
  - how to access that content.
- **Library stakeholders** who, in representing both business stakeholders and the public, seek knowledge about what content exists and how to access that content.

An analysis of the needs of these stakeholders:

- will lead to design improvements to DOTS and its user interface, delivering greater benefit to content seekers, and
- carries **open data implications**. Consideration of the needs of the diverse, largely non-technical, internal WSDOT user base will provide beneficial information regarding design to meet open data needs.

Additionally, better knowledge of the content inventoried by DOTS will help business and library stakeholders to better serve public information requests and more efficiently determine what data can, and should, be published as open data.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to conduct initial work for a full business analysis of the DOTS tool. WSDOT stakeholders will leverage project deliverables to complete the business analysis, leading to design improvements to DOTS and delivering greater benefit to WSDOT stakeholders and seekers of public and open data.

## Deliverables

_Interim_

1. **DOTS Investigation:** Initial report analyzing current state of DOTS tool and interface, based on intern&#39;s research of DOTS, available DOTS documentation, and interviews with technical stakeholders (Gordon Kennedy and Andy Everett).
2. **Librarian Interview Schedule and Initial Business Stakeholder List:** Define a schedule for interviewing each of the librarian stakeholders.  Create a Business Stakeholder List initialized with the librarians. In the process of working with the librarians a larger list of agency wide business stakeholders will emerge.
3. **Elicitation Approach:** Develop an approach to be used to elicit needs, including a proposed questionnaire and whether to group interviewees or hold strictly one-on-one interviews. Are there other sources besides interviewing stakeholders available? This activity can be in collaboration with technical stakeholders and WSDOT&#39;s assigned business analyst.
4. **Stakeholder Interview Report:** Based on stakeholder interviews, a report including transcripts, notes, and other materials from the interviews. Also, consider additional stakeholders, as suggested by interview participants, and revisions to the elicitation approach.
5. **Draft personas and user stories:** Based on stakeholder interview report, development of full personas and derived, high-level user stories.

_End of project_

- **Final report** containing business analysis personas and derived user stories, as informed by the above interim deliverables. Provide a presentation of findings to WSDOT stakeholders in Olympia. Based on knowledge gleaned from the business analysis, the final report also will highlight implications regarding data literacy and open data and recommend potential next steps based on open data best practices.

**Plan for Sustainability**
All deliverables and work materials will be stored in WSDOT-managed environments and accessed via WSDOT tools (e.g., a WSDOT-issued laptop computer or a desktop computer at a WSDOT-managed facility). This will help streamline collaboration, handoff of project deliverables, and sustainability. It also will aid compliance with State of Washington ethics and workplace conduct rules, a requirement of the project.

The personas and other business-analysis products from this project will be used by WSDOT&#39;s DOTS technical team to develop use cases for further work on DOTS. The DOTS application has dedicated support funding which allows ongoing maintenance and improvement of the code; thus, WSDOT has the practical ability to apply the lessons learned in this project.
