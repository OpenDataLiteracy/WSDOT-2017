# Project Interest Document

## Tim Blankemeyer - Background

I am a second-year student in the MLIS program at the University of Washington's Information School. My emphases at UW have been data science and visualization, data curation, and open data. Currently, I am finishing a Capstone project under the Open Data Literacy umbrella in which my team is working with a state agency to use an open-source platform and open, found data to visualize and communicate linkages between environmental restoration projects and outcomes such as water quality measures and salmon counts.

Beyond my UW experience, I have a masterâ€™s degree in journalism and a B.S. in chemical engineering. I worked for more than 10 years in print and online news media, during which time I also gained valuable experience as the editorial liaison to our product team on a custom CMS development project with Adobe. I also have ample experience as a technical writer and editor, including more than 2 years at Microsoft producing operational process documentation and online training materials.

## My Interest in the Project

I find this project with WSDOT's data catalog fascinating in that it is taking on crucial aspects of open data best practices, including making data and data products more discoverable, interoperable, and reusable. Data products derived from available data can be as valuable, if not more valuable, than the data itself, as they add value by connecting multiple data sources with context and knowledge provided by human experts. Not having these data products represented and discoverable risks more time spent recreating this valuable knowledge or even loss of that knowledge.

I'm also keen to learn more about how the Data or Term Search (DOTS) tools is implemented, how the tool is being used, and what other pain points around the tool exist. I think an important part of the project will be to determine the needs and characteristics of DOTS users, as well as what alternative discovery pathways have developed organically around DOTS or outside the tool. This knowledge can help inform revisions to DOTS and future integration with WSDOT Libraries online public access catalog, a deliverable mentioned in the project description.

## Potential Project Resources

(Thanks to Nic Weber for guidance here!)

__PROV Model Primer (https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-primer/):__

The PROV data model, developed by a W3C working group, is intended to "enable the inter-operable interchange of provenance information in heterogeneous environments such as the Web" ([PROV-Overview](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-prov-overview-20130430/)). The model promotes consistency around provenance and provides guidelines for provenance representation and implementation, as well as mapping to Dublin Core -- which may be useful when integration with the WSDOT Libraries online public access catalog is considered.

__Metalicious (https://github.com/OpenDataLiteracy/metalicious):__

Metalicious is an open-source, web-based data dictionary developed using MySQL Community Server and PHP. Per the README file on the above GitHub link, metalicious "is designed to capture and display metadata from databases, tables, and fields for platforms with one or more databases." It originally was developed for the City of Chicago; their implementation is at http://datadictionary.cityofchicago.org/ (currently down for maintenance). This open-source tool may serve as both a code resource and inspiration for this project.

## Initial Questions for Mentor

1. The project description lists as a key deliverable a document addressing the question "How do we provide a means to search for open data?" in the context of the DOTS tool. Who are the main users of DOTS and what are their characteristics? Are they primarily state employees, or is the public at large also an audience to consider?

2. How are users currently discovering data products derived from the DOTS inventory? Are there any informal or formal alternative discovery pathways that have developed?
